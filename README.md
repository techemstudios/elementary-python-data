# Elementary Python Data 1
## Code Em Assignment - Middle Intermediate
Jupyter notebooks for basic lists, dictionaries and data fundamentals.

## Setup
We covered setting up Jupyter Notebooks in your Cloud9 environments. You can reference [this repo](https://github.com/techemstudios/MyFirstWebsite) that reviews settings and setup for running a service on your Cloud9. The trick is to use your environment id (a hash code) in a url to access the notebook from your local browser.

## Minimum Requirements

* Follow along the Data 1 notebook and add code as appropriate.
* Your submitted assignment should include a notebook that has been with your additional code/solutions.

## Additional Requirements (think extra credit)

* Move the code into a Python program file and create a separate program file tester (using unittest).

## Rubric

| Criteria | Superior (5) | Excellent (4) | OK (3) | Not OK (2) | Unsatisfactory (1) | Grade/Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Readability (50%) | The code is organized (modular) well documented, easy to read and follow. | The code is easy to read and well documented. | The code can be followed. | The code is not easily followed. | The code is a mess. |  |
| Specifications (40%) | The program works and meets all the requirements. | The program works and meets most of the requirements. | The program produces correct results but does not display/plot them correctly. | The program does not meet most of the requirements or fails to display or plot any. | Program does not work at all. |  |
| Efficiency (10%) | The code is highly efficient without affecting readability. | The code is reasonably efficient without affecting readability. | The code runs within a few seconds. | The code runs within a few minutes. | The code takes over an hour to run (or doesn't run at all). | |

## Git Process

 * Classroom creates a private repo for your assignment.
 * Clone this repo in your Cloud9 environment. That is `git clone <repo_name>`.
 * Do your work on the `dev` branch. That is `git checkout dev` in the Cloud9 console.
 * You will be saving your notebook using Jupyter. Jupyter will create many additional autosave files. You only need to commit changes to the main notebook file.
 * Commit and push to the `dev` branch as much as you want -- as much as needed.
 * To _submit_ your assignment will be to create a PR in your repo. This will signal us that your assignment is ready for review.
